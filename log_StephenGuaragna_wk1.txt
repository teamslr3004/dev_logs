Got together with group to discuss ideas of what the App will be.
it was decided to create an app using the android platform because that is what we were familiar with
the app will be created using android studio
different ideas were brought up such as a camera and collage application which is where the team name SLR comes in to play along with our initials.
Eventually, the team settled on a card game application that is commonly played in Cameroon.
the card game consits of 2-4 players using a standard deck with the ace, king, queen, and jack removed.
the goal of the game is to play a card and the opposing player has to play a card with the same suit of higher value to take control. person in control at the end of the game is the winner.
